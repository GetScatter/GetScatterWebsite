            <!--<h3>Using ScatterJS</h3>-->
            <!--ScatterJS ( scatter-js ) is an importable JavaScript library for web and desktop applications that allows you to easily interface with Scatter Classic ( extension ), Desktop-->
            <!--and mobile all with one library.-->

            <!--<h4>Importing to NodeJS based project ( angular, react, vuejs, etc )</h4>-->
            <!--<pre>-->
                <!--<code></code>-->
            <!--</pre>-->

            <i>See the sub-links on the side for detailed information about setting your web/desktop/mobile projects up.</i>
            <br><br>

            For <b>web applications</b> you can import the ScatterJS library into your project which allows you to interface with Scatter Classic ( extension ), Desktop
            and mobile all with one library, so that you only have to write code once to be able to interact with all three.
            <br>
            <br>
            For <b>desktop and mobile apps</b> you will need to open a local websocket that interacts with Scatter. Though you don't have to use them a few plugins are slowly being made
            available to help facilitate this from certain frameworks such as Unity3d and Unreal Engine 4.
